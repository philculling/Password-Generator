# Password-Generator
Week 5 Challenge

Second practice with JavaScript
## Description
I wanted to create a password generator that would generate a randomised password to a specified length using characters from specified arrays. The length and arrays to be used were to be chosen by the user.
This work would enable me to learn more use of JavaScript, especially functions.
I wanted to improve on previous work by successfully adding my screenshot to this README!
I wanted to reinforce good habits of commenting out, and frequent commits.
I wanted to practise further my interaction with github.
I wanted to deploy my finished product and check it had no errors.
I wanted to practise writing an appropriate README.md.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage

When the website is viewed, the user is asked to choose:
- number of characters in password
- if they want to use lower case
- if they want to use upper case
- if they want to use special characters
- if they want to use numeric characters
The website will then create and display a randomised password based on the user's choices above.
